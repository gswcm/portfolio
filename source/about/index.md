## Origin and background
I was born and raised in **Russia** where I also received my basic education including both BS and MS degrees in **Electrical Engineering**. Then, in 2005 I followed steps of my friends and went to USA to work on my Ph.D. Upon completion the Degree in 2008 I was hired in the rank of Assistant Professor at Georgia Southwestern State University. I received a **tenured status** and promotion for **Associate Professor** in 2014.  

## Professional intersets
For many years I was engaged with a variety of engineering problems including but not limited to development of control algorithms, signal processing, robotics, etc. About 5 years ago I started learning JS and CSS to customize UI (by utilizing [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) browser extension) of one web resource that was mandatory in our University.
