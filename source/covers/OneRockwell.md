I am super excited to discover a hiring company that lists strongest shades of my developer profile as job requirements. More specifically

-	you looking for someone who can _write well organized, robust code with maintainability and scalability in mind_ &mdash; in my opinion robustness and scalability are the _must have_ features of any modern software. I do know some tricks but will be pleased with a chance to learn and use some others. 
-	you need someone who can _employ a patient attention to detail; produce high-quality results_ &mdash; I believe in details and their importance for usability and intuitiveness of the interfaces. This is what I teach my students to do &mdash; to respect details. 
-	the qualifications you are asking about fits in well with my skillset. It includes but is not limited to Node.js + Express + MongoDB to run the _backend_ and HTML5 augmented with Vue to run the _frontend_. I am also comfortable to use Webpack and am ready to adopt (if needed) to some other bundling/building facility. 

I am looking for a change in my professional occupation because my present employment no longer challenges me enough so I could say "I am the one of only a few who can do it". I really would like to be employed by a company where my potential can be opened and exploited to the full capacity, where my 10 years of educational experience can serve the need of project management and successfull  collaboration, where my tune for details handling can be hired to create progressive and usable interfaces. 

In short, I do believe that One Rockwell can be that place.
