I am a full stack developer who puts a big emphasis on usability and responsiveness of the frontend. I also have a good understanding of how the frontend needs to be composed so it can be a good fit for an existing or newly developed backend. I always analyze UI from the standpoint of "natural consumption" which means it has to be minimal, efficient, and highly intuitive.

My pros:
-	have an experience writing responsive HTML and CSS (without using a full CSS framework like Bootstrap) for clients or companies
-	have an experience maintaining markup and CSS on a client or company project for more than two years

My cons:
-	I do not have a strong (only limited) grasp of SCSS and experience using it on large projects, but would be glad to pick it up real quick when needed.
-	I am not located in Portland but I am willing to relocate to the area once hired. I've been in Portland once and I am in love with this area.

Here is a link to my professional portfolio https://baev.work that has a section dedicated to one of my most recent development &mdash; registration portal for the High School Math Tournament directly accessible at https://baev.work/project

That project in live form can be seen at https://hmt.gswcm.net Despite the registration is currently closed, you still can take a look at the results page available at https://hmt.gswcm.net/stats to check its responsiveness.

I can be found at GitHub under `gswcm` account.
