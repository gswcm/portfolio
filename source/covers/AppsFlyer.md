I am inclined to find myself as a full stack developer who puts a big emphasis on usability and responsiveness of the frontend. I have a good understanding of how the frontend needs to be composed so it can be a good fit for an existing or newly developed backend. I analyze UI from the standpoint of "natural consumption" which means it has to be minimal, efficient, and highly intuitive...

At the same time I do have _10 years_ of professional experience in a _higher education_ institution in the role of assistant (then associate) professor, teaching various CS/IT courses. When I've learned about this job opportunity, i.e. TECHNICAL INSTRUCTOR AND DEVELOPER I realized that my past and projected professional occupations can be merged together to light up my next development cycle. 

I never was a classical instructor with PPT-slides based lectures &mdash; instead I always was **challenging** students to gain and then demo their knowledge rather than to memorize book material. It is the _challenge_ that makes today's student being tomorrow's professional, and I want to be there, on that edge, to support this transition. I am very much excited about modern web technology and am willing to switch my comfortable tenured academia hosted occupation to something flavoured with pasion, freshness, and professional satisfaction &mdash; I hope to find all these at AppsFlyer.
