I am super excited to find a hiring company that lists strongest shades of my developer profile as job requirements. More specifically
-	you ask about knowledge and/or experience with frontend frameworks, and you name Vue as preferred option &mdash; I just recently finished a Vue-based project (please see my portfolio site for more details) and I find this framework "a must" to learn and use because of its intuitiveness and transparency
-	you ask about _familiarity with responsive design and implementation_ &mdash; I find the need for responsiveness of UI designs to be a major requirement, and I am pretty good with BS4 layouts and Flex CSS
-	you require _direct participation in the decision making process_ &mdash; I cannot see myself working on something without playing an active role in planing the development path... I want to be involved... I cannot stay aside

Currently I am employed by a Higher Education Institution to teach various undergraduate and graduate CS/IT courses. The problem is... there is not much I can do to **stay satisfied** with my work. It all depends on qualification of students that they gain prior coming to our Institution, and unfortunately their qualification isn't sufficient. Most of them prefer complaining over focusing on self-development. 

I don't want to waste my days without professional satisfaction --- the satisfaction that I hope to gain while working in ActiveProspect. I truly believe that my satisfaction will not be a one-way road: my experience, my desire to create and optimise, my willing to be a significant part of something that I can be proud of &mdash; all these things make me believe that I can be good for ActiveProspect too.
